Thanks for wanting to contribute! For personal Advent of Code repos, contributions are usually personal. If you want to keep it open-source, consider creating pull requests for alternative solutions or tests.

- Fork the repo
- Create a branch per day: `day01-some-improvement`
- Add tests under `tests/` and keep solutions idempotent
- Run `python -m pytest` before creating a PR
